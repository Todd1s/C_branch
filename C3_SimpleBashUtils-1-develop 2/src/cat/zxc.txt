Let me introduce myself. 
	My name 	is Mariya I am a 20-year-old student from.
	I study at the university in my native town and my future profession is bookkeeping. 
I live with my parents and my elder sister Lena. 
	We are a friendly family. 
	Lena is 2 years older than me. We share our room and tell all our secrets to each other.

We are very much alike: open-hearted, smart and merry. 

That's why we have a lot of friends. 

I like organizing parties for our friends as we often gather to­gether, discuss our plans and have fun.
